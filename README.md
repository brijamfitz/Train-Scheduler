# Train Scheduler

Experience here: [Train Scheduler](https://brijamfitz.github.io/Train-Scheduler/)

This application allows a user to create their very own train schedule.

There are inputs for the following values:
* Train name
* Destination
* Time of first train of the day
* Frequency or interval between trains

The app captures this input, and builds a train schedule in real time. Along with the information the user has given, the scheduler also returns to the user the time of the next train arrival, and how many minutes away the next train is!

The data is stored on Firebase, and Moment.js is used to calculate the schedule in real time! Because the data persists on Firebase, a user can leave the app, return later, and still have access to their train schedule.

**Tech used:**
* Javascript
* JQuery
* Firebase
* Moment.js
